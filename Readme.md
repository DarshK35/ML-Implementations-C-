# Machine Learning Concept Implementations in C++

This repository will contain various ML concepts like perceptrons, neural networks, etc. implemented in C++.


NOTE: This repo is discontinued due to complications with C++ memory management and custom data structures since C++ doesn't have in-built structures for handling matrices and matrix operations.
